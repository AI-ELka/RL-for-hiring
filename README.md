To streamline the transformation of a candidate's profile and job description into a comprehensive score, a structured and systematic approach will be employed. The evaluation process will consist of three main components: profile matching, virtual interviews, and technical assessments.

1. **Profile Matching:**
   - Utilize a similarity check to assess the compatibility between the candidate's profile and the job description.
   - Employ a dedicated tool for profile matching, such as the one available at [Job Matcher](https://github.com/ahnineamine/Job-Matcher) or some advanced Scoring API .
   - This step aims to objectively measure how closely the candidate's qualifications align with the specified job requirements.

2. **Virtual Interviews:**
   - Conduct initial and final interviews through a virtual format.
   - Pose predefined questions to candidates and request them to record their responses.
   - Employ the MIT interview datasets, as outlined in the paper ["Automated Analysis and Prediction of Job Interview Performance"](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/automated-analysis-and-prediction-of-job), to predict scores based on interview performance.

3. **Technical Assessment:**
   - Administer a technical assessment using platforms such as [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/products/developer-skills-platform/screen/).
   - Leverage coding tests and other relevant tools to evaluate the candidate's technical proficiency.
   - This step ensures a thorough examination of the candidate's practical skills and problem-solving abilities related to the job requirements.

These tools can generate predictions of candidate performance scores, serving as inputs for our agent to anticipate either the candidate's rejection step or the eventual offer.
